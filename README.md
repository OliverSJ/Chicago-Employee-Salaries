# Chicago-Employee-Salaries

Chicago-Employee-Salaries, or ChiSalary, is an iOS app that allows users to search for Chicago employees' salary information based on various query options. For instance, users can directly search for an employee's name and find his/her annual salary (i.e. Rahm, Emanuel). Another option allows users to search for a department, look at a list of employees that work for that department, and then view each employee's salary.
